class method:

A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that
points to the class and not the object instance.
It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class.
For example it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.

staticmethod:

A static method is also a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
A static method canâ€™t access or modify class state.
It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.
